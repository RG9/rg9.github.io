## Hi, I'm Raf!

Welcome to my blog! I'm a passionate software developer specializing in backend [Java](/tags/java) development.
Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have deepened my expertise and "fueled" my
love for coding.

This blog serves as both a personal knowledge base and a space to share my experiences.
Here, you'll find practical ["code tips"](/categories/code-tips) I've gathered along the way, as well
as ["code stories"](/categories/code-deep-dives) from my day-to-day work.
Motto of this blog - "Learn, share, scale!" - was inspired by the approach
of [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/blog/about/).

Whether you're a fellow developer, someone interested in backend Java, or just passing by, I hope you find something
valuable here.
Feel free to explore, learn, and share your thoughts in the comments!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸ˜‰
