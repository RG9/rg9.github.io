I'm excited to share with you a new tool that I've been using to help protect my eyes while working on my computer. It's called `safe-eyes-cli` and it's inspired by the popular Safe Eyes application.

It's a "strict" break reminder based on [YAD](https://github.com/v1cont/yad). 

> A "strict break reminder program" is a software application designed to remind users to take regular breaks from their computer work. It enforces strict rules for breaks, such as locking the screen, displaying full-screen reminders, or disabling input devices during the break period. This ensures that users take breaks and rest their eyes, helping to prevent eye strain, repetitive stress injuries, and promoting overall wellbeing.

The tool is **customizable**, allowing to set the frequency and duration of breaks.

One of the great things about `safe-eyes-cli`  is **simplicity**. It's a shell script, that anyone can easily modify and adapt for special needs. Another killer feature is that it can **automatically pause during calls**, so you don't have to worry about interruptions while you're on an important call.

If you're interested in trying out `safe-eyes-cli` for yourself, you can find it on GitHub at [https://github.com/RG9/safe-eyes-cli](https://github.com/RG9/safe-eyes-cli). The installation instructions are straightforward and easy to follow.
