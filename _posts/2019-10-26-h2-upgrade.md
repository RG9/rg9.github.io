title: Adventure of H2 upgrade that lead to reveal Spring misconfiguration in my tests

Dependency upgrade sometimes may cause some fear of unknown ... especially when release contains 100+ changes :smile:
Recently I was updating H2 in tests sources to the latest version - [1.4.200](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-1.4.200).
My project is using H2 in compatibility mode with `MySQL` and this came out to be the root of all evil :wink:

Let's start from the beginning. Everything was going nearly smooth till ... one module, where tests were failing with werid exception:
```
org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: NULL not allowed for column "ASSETREVISION"; SQL statement:
insert into table (id, version, col_1, col_2, asset_revision) values (null, ?, ?, ?, ?) [23502-200]

	at my.project.TableManager.persist(TableManager.java:128)
  ```

What a heck is going on? Where this `NULL` comes from? How is it related to version upgrade?

Entity class looks like this:
```java
@javax.persistence.Entity
public class Table {

  @Column(nullable = false)
  private long assetRevision;

  /* .. other fields **/
}

```

Field type is primitive `long`, so default value will be `0L`. `NULL` is not possible.

Let's debug ...

Initially I couldn't reproduce bug, since single test class was green.
I had to run all tests in module. Worth mention that not all tests were broken. First 50% of executed tests were green and only a few executed later were red.

I started debugging from `org.h2.command.dml.Insert.insertRows`.
And yes, the column value was indeed `NULL`, but what intrigued me was **the number of columns**.
Statement use 5 columns, but table in database had 8 columns! Why number of columns differs? Why some columns where duplicated? It looked like this:
```
["ID", "VERSION", "COL_1", "COL_2", "ASSET_REVISION", "COL1", "COL2", "ASSETREVISION"]
```

Ok, so it's definitely not a fault of H2. Then why Hibernate is producing wrong statements?

I set breakpoint somewhere in `org.hibernate.mapping.Table` and application stopped on ... updating schema :smile:
When Hibernate couldn't find column with particular name, then he added one. Hibernate perfectly do his job!
Why then column name was different? The answer is ["hibernate naming strategy"](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-naming-strategy).
Came out that configurations of tests in my project were providing different naming strategies, however none of them was explicitly configured.
You may ask - how is it possible? :wink:

The module causing such troubles contains mix of test based on SpringBoot and "classic" Spring configuration.
Some test use autoconfiguration provided by `@SpringBootTest` and other ones configuration provided by `@ContextConfiguration`.
The problem is that SpringBoot by default use his own *hibernate naming strategy* - `org.springframework.boot.orm.jpa.hibernate.SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy`.
Here I must specify that I used Spring Boot 2 and Hibernate 5.
Following test shows the difference:
```
Identifier identifier = new Identifier("assetRevision", false);
PhysicalNamingStrategy springBootStrategy = new org.springframework.boot.orm.jpa.hibernate.SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy();
assertThat(springBootStrategy.toPhysicalColumnName(identifier, null)).hasToString("asset_revision");

PhysicalNamingStrategy hibernateStrategy = new org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl();
assertThat(hibernateStrategy.toPhysicalColumnName(identifier, null)).hasToString("assetRevision");
```

One of simplest solutions is to tell SpringBoot to use Hibernate's default:
```
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

Ok, but why it was working with previous version of H2?

I cloned H2 project from Github repo, then successfully reproduced my case and did `git bisect`.
Here is the culprit:
```
commit cedec8db5bd003d5566cb93cfc32f916e1ccd603

    Remove Mode.convertInsertNullToZero because MySQL is now STRICT by default
```

Well, as I said, my project use H2 in compatibility mode with `MySQL`.
Fabulous `Mode.convertInsertNullToZero`, removed in the latest version, was filling missing values in SQL statements with default ones.
That's why it was working before upgrade -  misconfiguration was unluckily hidden.

Could it be avoided? Is sharing H2 database instance among tests a good idea? Is SpringBoot autoconfiguration feature worth it?
I will leave it without answer. I'm not sure if such troubles can be avoided in the future :disappointed:
